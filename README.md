<br/>Click enter and find the correct path. Usually the path should be locate at C:\Program Files (x86)\WinMerge or C:\Program Files\WinMerge
<br/>Choose the WinMergeU.exe.
<br/>If you follow this pattern, you should be able to run the application without any errors or warnings.

<br/>At this point, you are ready to use the application.
<br/>Click Open Folder and choose the folder that you want to scan.
<br/>*Notice : the more images in the folder the longer the scan will be.
